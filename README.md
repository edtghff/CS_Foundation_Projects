# Foundations of Computer Science & Software Engineering

This repository contains the projects, scripts, and exercises developed during an intensive 7-day program on foundational computer science concepts and software engineering principles. 

## Curriculum Overview

### Day 1: Git, Command Line, and Bash Scripting
- **Git and command-line editors**
- **Bash scripting basics**
- Create and manage repositories, navigate directories, and automate tasks with Bash.

### Day 2: Advanced Bash & C Language Basics
- **Bash scripting**
- **Introduction to C programming**
- Learn the essentials of Bash scripting and how to write simple C programs. Set up automation with `makefiles`.

### Day 3: Pointers, Memory Management, Recursion (C)
- **C pointers and memory allocation (malloc/free)**
- **Recursion**
- Manage memory dynamically in C and implement recursive algorithms.

### Day 4: Advanced C Programming
- **Variadic functions**
- **Static libraries**
- **Preprocessor macros**
- Build reusable libraries and automate tasks with preprocessor macros.

### Day 5: Bit Manipulation & File I/O (C)
- **Bitwise operations in C**
- **File handling (reading/writing files)**
- Perform low-level operations on bits and handle file I/O in C.

### Day 6: Data Structures in C
- **Singly linked lists**
- **Hash tables**
- Implement fundamental data structures and algorithms in C.

### Day 7: Capstone Projects
- **Custom `printf` implementation**
- **Building a basic shell**
- Apply the concepts learned by building your own version of `printf` and a simple command-line shell.
